# Part-One #

## 1. If you do not know the answers, you need to  google it or try it out on your computer and give answers and find the best answer for all the interview question. In case you had tired it on your computer, please copy paste the C- code also into the answer sheet.

## 2. When submitting the answers, you need to write into a files interview-part1.md The file name extension is very important (it has to be .md)

## 3. When copy pasting the code encode the code ```` (Tick marks and not single quote) being the code with ```` and end with ```` this will make the code to be presented in a nice grey box. Look at other files which I had created.
