# Pointers to Pointers 

### Pointers to pointers are regular pointers except that they hold the address of another pointer which points to some memory location
When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that 
contains the actual value
A variable that is a pointer to a pointer must be declared as such. This is done by placing an additional asterisk in front of its name. For example, the following declaration declares a pointer to a pointer of type int âˆ’

int **var;

When a target value is indirectly pointed to by a pointer to a pointer, accessing that value requires that the asterisk operator be applied twice,

````
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   int  var;
   int  *ptr;
   int  **pptr;

   var = 3000;

   /* take the address of var */
   ptr = &var;

   /* take the address of ptr using address of operator & */
   pptr = &ptr;

   /* take the value using pptr */
   printf("Value of var = %d\n", var );
   printf("Value available at *ptr = %d\n", *ptr );
   printf("Value available at **pptr = %d\n", **pptr);

   return 0;
}
````
