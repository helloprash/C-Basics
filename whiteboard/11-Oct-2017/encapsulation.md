#Encapsulation in C++#

All C++ programs  two fundamental elements −

*Program statement* which are executed  − This is the part of a program that *performs actions on the data* and they are called functions/subroutines

*Data* − The data is the information of the program which gets *processed* by the program functions.

*Encapsulation* is an Object Oriented Programming concept that **couples** data and functions, and that keeps both safe from outside 
interference   and accidental misuse. 

*Data Hiding*:  When Data is encapsuled, we have an option of hiding the data. (*private* is the keyword)

*Data abstraction* is a method or approach  of  *exposing only the interfaces*  and hiding the implementation details from the user.
*public* is the keyword used for exposing the only required interface and hiding the rest

In C++ by default, all items members of class are *privite* that means all members are hidden by default, we need to explicity use the 
keyword *public* to expose them to outside world.
